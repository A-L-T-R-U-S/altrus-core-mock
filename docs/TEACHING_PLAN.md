# Teaching Plan: How to teach teammates to use the mock middleware

1. Quick intro (2 min): Explain what mock middleware does (receive, log, forward).
2. Run demo (5 min): Start mock, run emotion publisher, show logs.
3. Hands-on (15-20 min): Each teammate runs their sample publisher and watches middleware react.
4. Fault test (10 min): Instructor toggles health map in mock (set lidar False) to show rejection.
5. Wrap-up (3 min): Share checklist and next steps.
